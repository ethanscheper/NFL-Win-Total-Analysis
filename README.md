# NFL-Win-Total-Analysis #
### Basic analysis and aesthetic plotting of win totals for NFL teams compared to their preseason predicted win totals and previous years' win totals. ###
The notion of "preseason predicted win totals" comes from the betting lines for team win totals created by Vegas oddsmakers. This provides a method for seeing if teams underperfomed, met, or exceeded preseason expectations.
Comparisons between previous seasons currently only include comparisons of the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seasons because they are the only two full 17 game seasons played. Additionally, win totals from more than a single season out may not be indicative of future seasons' performance.
